Worked on a frontend prototype using the Google Maps API. I tried the following things:
+ Showing a Google Map, centered on the Dartmouth campus.
+ Adding images on top of the Map.
+ Making the images clickable, and showing a dialogue box if the user clicks on one of the images.
+ Removing / restoring the images from the map.
+ A sidebar with a list of events, which are also clickable with the dialogue box.

I learned:
+ How to set up the Google Maps API and do some things with out.
+ A basic UX / design for the front end.
+ How to factor the frontend code. I tried to make the event information not completely hardcoded.
